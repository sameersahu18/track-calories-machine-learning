## üìå Project Overview

Tracking calories manually can be time-consuming and inaccurate. This project uses machine learning to build a predictive model that estimates the number of calories burned based on physical activity and personal health metrics.

## üí° Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Model performance evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R¬≤)
- Interactive calorie prediction (via Streamlit or Flask)
- Visualizations for data insights

---

## üß† Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost (optional)

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- Age, Height, Weight
- Duration, Heart Rate, Body Temperature
- Calories burned (target)
