🥗 Track Calories – Machine Learning Project
This project uses Machine Learning to predict the number of calories burned based on various physical activity features such as duration, heart rate, body measurements, and more. It aims to help users monitor their fitness progress and daily calorie expenditure more accurately.

🚀 Features:
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature engineering and selection

Model training using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Model evaluation with metrics like MAE, RMSE

Interactive prediction interface (Streamlit/Flask if included)

Visualizations for better data understanding

📁 Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

(Optional: Streamlit/Flask for UI)

📊 Dataset:
The dataset includes user activity and biometric data used to train and test the calorie prediction model.
